# Binary Tree

## Challenge

[x] Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.
[x] Create a BinaryTree class
[x] Define a method for each of the depth first traversals called preOrder, inOrder, and postOrder which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.
[x] Create a BinarySearchTree class
[x] Define a method named add that accepts a value, and adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
[x] Define a method named contains that accepts a value, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.
