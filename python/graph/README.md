# Graph

## Challenge

- [x] Implement a graph.

-[x] The graph should be represented as an adjacency list.

-[x] Should incluse the methods: AddNode(), AddEdge(), GetNodes(), GetNeighbors()
Size().

-[x] Combine the key and corresponding values (if they exist) into a new data structure according to LEFT JOIN logic.

## Approach & Efficiency

> plan on using depth first traversal, because infinate loops. 

BIG O
TIME: O(n)-This means that as the input grows, the algorithms take proportionally longer to complete, but we are visiting each node once
SPACE: o(n)- it's a little. 

## Solution
